# Kafka Application

Design an In-Memory Distributed Queue like Kafka.

---
## Requirements
- The queue should be in-memory and should not require access to the file system.
- There can be multiple topics in the queue.
- A (string) message can be published on a topic by a producer/publisher and consumers/subscribers can subscribe to the topic to receive the messages.
- There can be multiple producers and consumers.
- A producer can publish to multiple topics.
- A consumer can listen to multiple topics.
- The consumer should print "<consumer_id> received <message>" on receiving the message.
- The queue system should be multi-threaded, i.e., messages can be produced or consumed in parallel by different producers/consumers.

---
## Input/Output Format
You do not need to take input from the command-line.
- Create 2 topics: topic1 and topic2
- Create 2 producers: producer1, and producer2
- Create 5 consumers: consumer1, consumer2, consumer3, consumer4, and consumer5
- Make all 5 consumers subscribe to topic1
- Make consumers 1, 3, and 4 subscribe to topic2
- Make producer1 publish a message "Message 1" to topic1
- Make producer1 publish a message "Message 2" to topic1
- Make producer2 publish a message "Message 3" to topic1
- Make producer1 publish a message "Message 4" to topic2
- Make producer2 publish a message "Message 5" to topic2

---
## Expectations
- Make sure that you have a working and demonstrable code
- Make sure that the code is functionally correct
- Code should be modular and readable
- Separation of concern should be addressed
- Please do not write everything in a single file (if not coding in C/C++)
- Code should easily accommodate new requirements and minimal changes
- There should be a main method from where the code could be easily testable
- [Optional] Write unit tests, if possible
- No need to create a GUI

---
## Optional Requirements
- Allow consumer groups. A consumer group can have multiple consumers and consumers mention their consumer group while subscribing to a topic. A message can be consumed by only one consumer per consumer group.
