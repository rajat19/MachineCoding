# Trello Application

Create a project management application (like Trello).

A project management application (like Trello) is where you can manage your project by tracking smaller tasks.

- The app contains multiple boards to signify different projects
- Each board contains different lists to signify sub-project
- Each list contains different cards signifying smaller tasks
- Each card can be assigned to a user or may remain unassigned

---
## Requirements
- User: Each user should have a userId, name, email.
- Board: Each board should have an id, name, privacy (PUBLIC/PRIVATE), url, members, lists
- List: Each list should have an id, name and cards
- Card: Each card should have an id, name, description, assigned user
- We should be able to create/delete boards, add/remove people from the members list and modify attributes. Deleting a board should delete all lists inside it.
- We should be able to create/delete lists and modify attributes. Deleting a list should delete all cards inside it.
- We should be able to create/delete cards, assign/unassigned a member to the card and modify attributes
- We should also be able to move cards across lists in the same board 
- Ability to show all boards, a single board, a single list and a single card
- Default privacy should be public
- Cards should be unassigned by default
- Ids should be auto-generated for a board/list/card
- URLs should get created based on the id

---
## Input
You can create a few users in your main method. No need to take it as input.
There will be different types of input:
```
BOARD CREATE
BOARD <name/privacy>
BOARD <ADD_MEMBER/REMOVE_MEMBER>
BOARD DELETE
LIST CREATE
LIST
LIST DELETE
CARD CREATE
CARD <name/description>
CARD ASSIGN
CARD UNASSIGN
CARD MOVE
CARD DELETE
SHOW
SHOW BOARD
SHOW LIST
SHOW CARD
```

If you want you create these in the main method without taking user input.

---
## Output
- CREATE operations should print the id after creation
- SHOW should print all the boards with all the lists inside them and all the cards inside all the lists (including all the attributes)
- SHOW <BOARD/LIST> should print that specific entity and everything inside it (including all the attributes)
- SHOW CARD should print all the attributes of the card

You can use any format to print these. Printing in json is not compulsory.

## Expectations
- Make sure that you have a working and demonstrable code
- Make sure that the code is functionally correct
- Code should be modular and readable
- Separation of concern should be addressed
- Please do not write everything in a single file
- Code should easily accommodate new requirements and minimal changes
- There should be a main method from where the code could be easily testable
- [Optional] Write unit tests, if possible
- No need to create a GUI

---
## Optional Requirements
Please do these only if youâ€™ve time left. You can write your code such that these could be accommodated without changing your code much.

- Ability to clone a list with all the cards in it. All of these should have a different id.
- Ability to delete all the cards in a list without deleting the list.
- Option to add tags to a card and ability to get cards based on assigned tags.
- Ability to find all the cards assigned to a particular user.
